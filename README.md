Introduction
OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access users' resources on other platforms (like Google, Facebook, etc.) without sharing their credentials. It provides a secure and reliable way for applications to request and obtain limited access to users' resources without exposing their credentials.

OAuth 2.0 Flows
There are several OAuth 2.0 grant types or flows available, depending on the use case:

Authorization Code Flow: Suitable for server-side applications, where the client (application) can securely store the client secret.
Implicit Flow: Designed for client-side applications (like JavaScript running in a browser) that cannot securely store the client secret.
Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow: Used when the user trusts the application enough to provide their username and password directly.
Client Credentials Flow: Applicable when the client application itself is the resource owner.
Why OAuth 2.0 PKCE
The Authorization Code Flow is considered one of the most secure OAuth 2.0 flows. However, for public clients (like mobile and single-page applications), it may still be vulnerable to an attack called the "authorization code interception attack." The attacker could intercept the authorization code returned from the authorization server and use it to obtain an access token.

OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is an extension to the Authorization Code Flow that helps to mitigate the risk of authorization code interception attacks. It is highly recommended for public clients and other environments where the client secret cannot be securely stored.

How PKCE Works
The client generates a random string called the "code verifier" and derives the "code challenge" from the code verifier using a transformation method (either plain or S256).
The client initiates the authorization request and includes the code challenge and transformation method.
The authorization server returns the authorization code after the user grants permission.
The client requests an access token by sending the authorization code, code verifier, and other required parameters to the token endpoint.
The authorization server validates the code verifier against the previously received code challenge and, if valid, issues an access token to the client.
By using PKCE, the client proves that it initiated the original authorization request, and the attacker cannot obtain the access token even if they manage to intercept the authorization code.

Conclusion
OAuth 2.0 PKCE is an essential security measure for public clients and environments where the client secret cannot be securely stored. It adds an extra layer of security to the Authorization Code Flow, preventing attackers from intercepting authorization codes and gaining unauthorized access to users' resources. Implementing PKCE is highly recommended for mobile and single-page applications, ensuring a more secure and reliable authentication process.
